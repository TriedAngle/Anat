  <h1>Anat</h1>
  <strong> A library to represent natural numbers as well-founded sets </strong> for the rust and python programming language.

-----

## Installation

### Rust
1. install the latest version of the rust toolchain: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
2. create a new rust project with `cargo new <name>` or use an existing one
3. add `anat = 1.0.1` to your project's `Cargo.toml`

### Python
1. install python (try anaconda maybe?: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
2. include the python file inside your project and import it (pip upload will come soon probably)

#### Disclaimer
Creating or using numbers above 1000 is strongly discouraged as the
memory representation of these numbers is highly inefficient.

My window manager (Arch + BSWPM, i7 5930k + 16GB ram) freezes between 1000-10000.
